Not giving enough time.
Until now the only thing i focused on was the number of questions i solved. But i realize it now.
It dosent work like that.I thought that i am the best and once again its false. There are poeple who are working harder than you.
You need to work harder and beat everyone.
So contribute more days to each topic. Once you master that topic then you will be the goat.
Dont lose hope and strive to be the best.
