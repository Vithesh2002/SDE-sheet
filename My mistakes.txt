>Today i got some problem because i had two strings and had to perform operation on both. In the question it wasnt mentioned that both the string have same size but still i took n=length of first string. I should have taken the length of second String. i was so dumb here. From next time just see this.

>Always check if there is any negative numbers while your are using frequency arrays.

>Just dont randomly put increment or decrement operator randomly ..this matters a lot..No problem if the code looks lengthy. just make it perfect..

>i and j will be a confusion. Because if you put i instead of j or j instead of i then it will surely result in stack overflow..or infinite loop.

>Dont let your ego cotrol you...dont hesitate in using visited array while performing a travering problems.

>Dont overthink.

>Getting overexcited after solving...but you could solve it in a better way.

>Unnecessary conditional statements...

>Do not forget the inbuilt function. just because you solved hard problems where we dont use an inbuilt funstion doesn't mean that you  cant use any inbuilt functions.

>Dont forget which variable to use while performing any operations.

>While doing binnary search ...if you keep looping condition as low<=high then we should remember that low=mid or high=mid will always result in infinite loop. 
we can do that if looping condition is low<high

>Correctly check if you have applied conditional operator or not.Dont get lost while colpy pasting the code.

>You have solved so many question and today you failed to open your mind.You got a triplet problem which was based on 3sum on leetcode.You are such a dumb ass that whenever you see a problem that has some set type thing in it.You think about subset and recursion.You are so obsessed with recursion and making a problem so complicated that you go blind. When solving a question dont jump directly into complication. Think for some time. Think from basics.
