>Today i got some problem because i had to strings and had to perform operation on both. In the question it wasnt mentioned that both the string have same size but still i took n=length of first string. I should have taken the length of second String. i was so dumb here. From next time just see this.

>Always check if there is any negative numbers while your are using frequency arrays.

>Just dont randomly put increment or decrement operator randomly ..this matters a lot..No problem if the code looks lengthy. just make it perfect..

>i and j will be a confusion. Because if you put i instead of j or j instead of i then it will surely result in stack overflow..or infinite loop.

>Dont let your ego cotroll you...dont hesitate in using visited array while performing a travering problems.

>Dont overthink.
