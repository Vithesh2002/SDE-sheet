>Today i got some problem because i had two strings and had to perform operation on both. In the question it wasnt mentioned that both the string have same size but still i took n=length of first string. I should have taken the length of second String. i was so dumb here. From next time i wont do this.

>Always check if there is any negative numbers while your are using frequency arrays.

>Just dont randomly put increment or decrement operator randomly ..this matters a lot..No problem if the code looks lengthy. just make it perfect..

>i and j will be a confusion. Because if you put i instead of j or j instead of i then it will surely result in stack overflow..or infinite loop.

>Dont let your ego cotrol you...dont hesitate in using visited array while performing a travering problems.

>Dont overthink.

>Getting overexcited after solving...but you could solve it in a better way.

>Unnecessary conditional statements...

>Dont forget which variable to use while performing any operations.

>While doing binnary search ...if we keep looping condition as low<=high then we should remember that low=mid or high=mid will always result in infinite loop. 
we can do that if looping condition is low<high

>Correctly check if you have applied conditional operator or not.Dont get lost while copy pasting the code.
